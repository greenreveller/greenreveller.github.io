          <p class="lead">Careers are becoming increasingly non-linear &ndash; you don’t have to have a job for life, you may have 4 or 5! This brings excitement and boundless opportunities and you need the right mindset and skillset to take advantage of them. Many of my clients ask the same questions:</p>
          <ul>
            <li class="lead">What skills do I have and which ones could I develop?</li>
            <li class="lead">Can I change my career? How do I do it?</li>
            <li class="lead">How do I network effectively to keep my options open?</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="lead"> Sound familiar? I offer a <strong>free</strong> exploratory 25 minute careers consultation with no obligation to continue <a class="btn btn-success btn-lg" href="mailto:andrea.sv.cox+careers@gmail.com?subject=Free careers consultation"role="button">Book Now</a></p>

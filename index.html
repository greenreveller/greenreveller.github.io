          <p class="lead">Careers are becoming increasingly non-linear &ndash; you don’t have to have a job for life, you may have 4 or 5! This brings excitement and boundless opportunities and you need the right mindset and skillset to take advantage of them. Many of my clients ask the same questions:</p>
          <ul>
            <li class="lead">What skills do I have and which ones could I develop?</li>
            <li class="lead">Can I change my career? How do I do it?</li>
            <li class="lead">How do I network effectively to keep my options open?</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="lead"> Sound familiar? I offer a <strong>free</strong> exploratory 25 minute careers consultation with no obligation to continue <a class="btn btn-success btn-lg" href="mailto:andrea.sv.cox+careers@gmail.com?subject=Free careers consultation"role="button">Book Now</a></p>

            <p class="lead">I’m passionate about helping my clients become happier and more fulfilled at work. I trained as a coach through the Career Counselling Services in a course accredited by the Association for Coaching. I coach clients across a range of sectors but I began my own career in teaching and then moved into the data/technology sector specialising in business development and account management. I also work as a mentor and coach to young people through the TeachFirst Futures programme and Young Enterprise.</p>

          <blockquote class="lead">"I found Andrea's calm and considered guidance invaluable when trying to make a choice between two career paths. She helped me to cut through my confusion, to identify my real priorities and use these as a framework to help my decision-making. I left the session with some clear next steps and – perhaps most importantly – confidence in my ability to make the right choice. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend her services."
